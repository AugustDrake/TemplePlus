(https://ci.appveyor.com/project/shartte/templeplus)

## Quickstart

* Get Microsoft Visual Studio
* Get a Git client (such as Source Tree). You can switch to Visual Studio's built in Source Control later.
* Clone the repository (use the HTTPS URL instead of the SSH URL so you can use Visual Studio's Git integration).
* Configure the solution so it points to your ToEE folder when running the debugger (right click ->  Properties -> Configuration Properties -> Debugging -> Working Directory)
* Download the dependency binaries from here: 
  https://github.com/GrognardsFromHell/TemplePlusDependencies/releases/tag/1.0
  And unzip them into the dependencies directory.
* Press F5 :)
