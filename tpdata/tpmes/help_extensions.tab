TEST				Title	Beware the mischievous terminator character! Please verify via a hex editor that the file ends in 0D0A.
TAG_HIT_DICE				Hit Dice	This line gives the creature's number and type of Hit Dice (the die rolled to generate hit points), and lists any bonus hit points. A parenthetical note gives the average hit points for a creature of the indicated number of Hit Dice. A creature's Hit Dice total is also treated as its level for determining how spells affect the creature, its rate of natural healing, and its maximum ranks in a skill.
TAG_RADIAL_MENU_DISABLE_AOOS	TAG_INGAME			Disable Attacks of Opportunity	Sometimes, you want to hold off on Attacks of Opportunity - for instance if you have an invisible Rogue whose sneak attack you wish to conserve for the right time. This will make your character skip their AoOs.
TAG_CRAFT_WAND	TAG_FEATS_DES		TAG_ITEM_CREATION	Craft Wand	You can create wands, which hold spells.     Prerequisite: ~Caster Level~[TAG_CASTER_LEVEL] 5th     Benefit: You can create a wand of any 4th-level or lower spell that you know.  You may also create a few special wands of higher level spells.     The base price of a wand is:                         its caster level  x  the spell level  x  750 gp     To craft a wand, you must spend 1/25 of this base price in ~XP~[TAG_EXPERIENCE_AND_LEVELS] and use up raw materials costing one-half of this base price.  A newly created wand has 50 charges.     Any wand that stores a spell with a costly material component or an XP cost also carries a commensurate cost.  In addition to the cost derived from the base price, you must expend fifty copies of the material component or pay fifty times the XP cost.
TAG_DIVINE_MIGHT	TAG_FEATS_DES			Divine Might	As a ~free action~[TAG_FREE_ACTION], spend one of your ~turn or rebuke undead~[TAG_TURN] attempts to add your ~Charisma~[TAG_CHARISMA] bonus to your weapon damage for 1 full ~round~[TAG_COMBAT].
TAG_HEZROU_STENCH				Hezrou Stench	A Hezrou's skin produces a foul-smelling, toxic liquid whenever it fights. Any living creature (except other demons) within 10 feet must succeed on a DC 24 Fortitude save or be nauseated for as long as it remains within the affected area and for 1d4 rounds afterward. Creatures that successfully save are sickened for as long as they remain in the area. A creature that successfully saves cannot be affected again by the same Hezrou's stench for 24 hours. A delay poison or neutralize poison spell removes either condition from one creature. Creatures that have immunity to poison are unaffected, and creatures resistant to poison receive their normal bonus on their saving throws. The save DC is Constitution-based.
TAG_CLASS_FEATURES_MONK_QUIVERING_PALM	TAG_MONKS			Quivering Palm	Starting at 15th level, a monk can set up vibrations within the body of another creature that can thereafter be fatal if the monk so desires.  She can use this quivering palm attack once a week, and she must announce her intent before making her ~attack roll~[TAG_ATTACK_ROLL].  Constructs, oozes, plants, undead, incorporeal creatures, and creatures immune to ~critical hits~[TAG_CRITICAL_HIT] cannot be affected.  Otherwise, if the monk strikes successfully and the target takes damage from the blow, the quivering palm attack succeeds.  Thereafter the monk can try to slay the victim at any later time, as long as the attempt is made within a number of days equal to her monk level.  To make such an attempt, the monk merely wills the target to die (a ~free action~[TAG_FREE_ACTION]), and unless the target makes a ~Fortitude~[TAG_FORTITUDE] ~saving throw~[TAG_SAVING_THROW_DESC] (DC 10 + 1/2 the monk's level + the monk's ~Wis~[TAG_WISDOM] modifier), it dies.  If the saving throw is successful, the target is no longer in danger from that particular quivering palm attack, but it may still be affected by another one at a later time.
TAG_CLASS_FEATURES_MONK_EMPTY_BODY	TAG_MONKS			Empty Body	At 19th level, a monk gains the ability to assume an ethereal state for 1 round per monk level per day.  She may go ethereal on a number of different occasions during any single day, as long as the total number of rounds spent in an ethereal state does not exceed her monk level.
TAG_CLASS_FEATURES_MONK_PERFECT_SELF	TAG_MONKS			Perfect Self	At 20th level, a monk becomes a magical creature.  She is forevermore treated as an outsider rather than as a humanoid (or whatever the monk's creature type was) for the purpose of spells and magical effects.  Additionally, the monk gains ~damage reduction~[TAG_SPECIAL_ABILITIES_DAMAGE_REDUCTION] 10/magic, which allows her to ignore the first 10 points of damage from any attack made by a nonmagical weapon or by any natural attack made by a creature that doesn't have similar damage reduction.  Unlike other outsiders, the monk can still be brought back from the dead as if she were a member of her previous creature type.Note: In ToEE, this will only apply the DR 10/Magic effect.
TAG_TRIP_ATTACK_OF_OPPORTUNITY	TAG_INGAME			Trip Attack of Opportunity	This tactical option will make your character do Trip Attacks when performing Attacks of Opportunity. Beware the counter-attempts!     Note that characters with Improved Trip will not gain a free attack on an AoO, since you may only perform free actions on your own turn.
TAG_WEAPON_SEEKING	TAG_DUMMY			Seeking	Only ranged weapons can have the seeking ability. The weapon veers toward its target, negating any miss chances that would otherwise apply, such as from concealment. (The wielder still has to aim the weapon at the right square. Arrows mistakenly shot into an empty space, for example, do not veer and hit invisible enemies, even if they are nearby.)Prerequisites:CL 12th; ~Craft Magic Arms and Armor~[TAG_CRAFT_MAA], ~True Seeing~[TAG_SPELLS_TRUE_SEEING]; Price +1 bonus.
TAG_CLASS_FEAT_GREATER_RAGE	TAG_BARBARIANS			Greater Rage	At 11th level, a barbarian's bonuses to Strength and Constitution during his ~rage~[TAG_CLASS_FEATURES_BARBARIAN_RAGE] each increase to +6, and his morale bonus on Will saves increases to +3. The penalty to AC remains at -2.
TAG_SPELLS_POLAR_RAY	TAG_SPELLS		TAG_SORCERER_8 TAG_WIZARD_8	Polar Ray	~Evocation~[TAG_MAGIC_SCHOOLS_EVOCATION] (Cold)Level: ~Sorcerer~[TAG_SORCERERS]/~Wizard~[TAG_WIZARDS] 8Components: V, SCasting Time: 1 ~standard action~[TAG_STANDARD_ACTION]Range: Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)Effect: RayDuration: InstantaneousSaving Throw: NoneSpell Resistance: YesA blue-white ray of freezing air and ice springs from your hand. You must succeed on a ranged ~touch attack~[TAG_TOUCH_ATTACK] with the ray to deal damage to a target. The ray deals 1d6 points of cold damage per ~caster level~[TAG_CASTER_LEVEL] (maximum 25d6).
TAG_BITE	TAG_WEAPONS			Bite Attack	The creature attacks with its mouth, dealing piercing, slashing, and bludgeoning damage.
