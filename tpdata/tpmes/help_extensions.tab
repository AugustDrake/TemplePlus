TAG_RADIAL_MENU_DISABLE_AOOS	TAG_INGAME			Disable Attacks of Opportunity	Sometimes, you want to hold off on Attacks of Opportunity - for instance if you have an invisible Rogue whose sneak attack you wish to conserve for the right time. This will make your character skip their AoOs.
TAG_CRAFT_WAND	TAG_FEATS_DES		TAG_ITEM_CREATION	Craft Wand	You can create wands, which hold spells.     Prerequisite: ~Caster Level~[TAG_CASTER_LEVEL] 5th     Benefit: You can create a wand of any 4th-level or lower spell that you know.  You may also create a few special wands of higher level spells.     The base price of a wand is:                         its caster level  x  the spell level  x  750 gp     To craft a wand, you must spend 1/25 of this base price in ~XP~[TAG_EXPERIENCE_AND_LEVELS] and use up raw materials costing one-half of this base price.  A newly created wand has 50 charges.     Any wand that stores a spell with a costly material component or an XP cost also carries a commensurate cost.  In addition to the cost derived from the base price, you must expend fifty copies of the material component or pay fifty times the XP cost.

TAG_HEZROU_STENCH				Hezrou Stench	A Hezrou's skin produces a foul-smelling, toxic liquid whenever it fights. Any living creature (except other demons) within 10 feet must succeed on a DC 24 Fortitude save or be nauseated for as long as it remains within the affected area and for 1d4 rounds afterward. Creatures that successfully save are sickened for as long as they remain in the area. A creature that successfully saves cannot be affected again by the same Hezrou's stench for 24 hours. A delay poison or neutralize poison spell removes either condition from one creature. Creatures that have immunity to poison are unaffected, and creatures resistant to poison receive their normal bonus on their saving throws. The save DC is Constitution-based.
