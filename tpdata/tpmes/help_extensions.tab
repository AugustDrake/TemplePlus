TEST				Title	Beware the mischievous terminator character! Please verify via a hex editor that the file ends in 0D0A.
TAG_HIT_DICE				Hit Dice	This line gives the creature's number and type of Hit Dice (the die rolled to generate hit points), and lists any bonus hit points. A parenthetical note gives the average hit points for a creature of the indicated number of Hit Dice. A creature's Hit Dice total is also treated as its level for determining how spells affect the creature, its rate of natural healing, and its maximum ranks in a skill.
TAG_RADIAL_MENU_DISABLE_AOOS	TAG_INGAME			Disable Attacks of Opportunity	Sometimes, you want to hold off on Attacks of Opportunity - for instance if you have an invisible Rogue whose sneak attack you wish to conserve for the right time. This will make your character skip their AoOs.
TAG_CRAFT_WAND	TAG_FEATS_DES		TAG_ITEM_CREATION	Craft Wand	You can create wands, which hold spells.     Prerequisite: ~Caster Level~[TAG_CASTER_LEVEL] 5th     Benefit: You can create a wand of any 4th-level or lower spell that you know.  You may also create a few special wands of higher level spells.     The base price of a wand is:                         its caster level  x  the spell level  x  750 gp     To craft a wand, you must spend 1/25 of this base price in ~XP~[TAG_EXPERIENCE_AND_LEVELS] and use up raw materials costing one-half of this base price.  A newly created wand has 50 charges.     Any wand that stores a spell with a costly material component or an XP cost also carries a commensurate cost.  In addition to the cost derived from the base price, you must expend fifty copies of the material component or pay fifty times the XP cost.
TAG_DIVINE_MIGHT	TAG_FEATS_DES			Divine Might	As a ~free action~[TAG_FREE_ACTION], spend one of your ~turn or rebuke undead~[TAG_TURN] attempts to add your ~Charisma~[TAG_CHARISMA] bonus to your weapon damage for 1 full ~round~[TAG_COMBAT].
TAG_HEZROU_STENCH				Hezrou Stench	A Hezrou's skin produces a foul-smelling, toxic liquid whenever it fights. Any living creature (except other demons) within 10 feet must succeed on a DC 24 Fortitude save or be nauseated for as long as it remains within the affected area and for 1d4 rounds afterward. Creatures that successfully save are sickened for as long as they remain in the area. A creature that successfully saves cannot be affected again by the same Hezrou's stench for 24 hours. A delay poison or neutralize poison spell removes either condition from one creature. Creatures that have immunity to poison are unaffected, and creatures resistant to poison receive their normal bonus on their saving throws. The save DC is Constitution-based.
TAG_CLASS_FEATURES_MONK_QUIVERING_PALM	TAG_MONKS			Quivering Palm	Starting at 15th level, a monk can set up vibrations within the body of another creature that can thereafter be fatal if the monk so desires.  She can use this quivering palm attack once a week, and she must announce her intent before making her ~attack roll~[TAG_ATTACK_ROLL].  Constructs, oozes, plants, undead, incorporeal creatures, and creatures immune to ~critical hits~[TAG_CRITICAL_HIT] cannot be affected.  Otherwise, if the monk strikes successfully and the target takes damage from the blow, the quivering palm attack succeeds.  Thereafter the monk can try to slay the victim at any later time, as long as the attempt is made within a number of days equal to her monk level.  To make such an attempt, the monk merely wills the target to die (a ~free action~[TAG_FREE_ACTION]), and unless the target makes a ~Fortitude~[TAG_FORTITUDE] ~saving throw~[TAG_SAVING_THROW_DESC] (DC 10 + 1/2 the monk's level + the monk's ~Wis~[TAG_WISDOM] modifier), it dies.  If the saving throw is successful, the target is no longer in danger from that particular quivering palm attack, but it may still be affected by another one at a later time.
TAG_CLASS_FEATURES_MONK_EMPTY_BODY	TAG_MONKS			Empty Body	At 19th level, a monk gains the ability to assume an ethereal state for 1 round per monk level per day.  She may go ethereal on a number of different occasions during any single day, as long as the total number of rounds spent in an ethereal state does not exceed her monk level.
TAG_CLASS_FEATURES_MONK_PERFECT_SELF	TAG_MONKS			Perfect Self	At 20th level, a monk becomes a magical creature.  She is forevermore treated as an outsider rather than as a humanoid (or whatever the monk's creature type was) for the purpose of spells and magical effects.  Additionally, the monk gains ~damage reduction~[TAG_SPECIAL_ABILITIES_DAMAGE_REDUCTION] 10/magic, which allows her to ignore the first 10 points of damage from any attack made by a nonmagical weapon or by any natural attack made by a creature that doesn't have similar damage reduction.  Unlike other outsiders, the monk can still be brought back from the dead as if she were a member of her previous creature type.Note: In ToEE, this will only apply the DR 10/Magic effect.
TAG_TRIP_ATTACK_OF_OPPORTUNITY	TAG_INGAME			Trip Attack of Opportunity	This tactical option will make your character do Trip Attacks when performing Attacks of Opportunity. Beware the counter-attempts!     Note that characters with Improved Trip will not gain a free attack on an AoO, since you may only perform free actions on your own turn.
TAG_WEAPON_SEEKING	TAG_DUMMY			Seeking	Only ranged weapons can have the seeking ability. The weapon veers toward its target, negating any miss chances that would otherwise apply, such as from concealment. (The wielder still has to aim the weapon at the right square. Arrows mistakenly shot into an empty space, for example, do not veer and hit invisible enemies, even if they are nearby.)Prerequisites:CL 12th; ~Craft Magic Arms and Armor~[TAG_CRAFT_MAA], ~True Seeing~[TAG_SPELLS_TRUE_SEEING]; Price +1 bonus.
TAG_CLASS_FEAT_GREATER_RAGE	TAG_BARBARIANS			Greater Rage	At 11th level, a barbarian's bonuses to Strength and Constitution during his ~rage~[TAG_CLASS_FEATURES_BARBARIAN_RAGE] each increase to +6, and his morale bonus on Will saves increases to +3. The penalty to AC remains at -2.
TAG_SPELLS_POLAR_RAY	TAG_SPELLS		TAG_SORCERER_8 TAG_WIZARD_8	Polar Ray	~Evocation~[TAG_MAGIC_SCHOOLS_EVOCATION] (Cold)Level: ~Sorcerer~[TAG_SORCERERS]/~Wizard~[TAG_WIZARDS] 8Components: V, SCasting Time: 1 ~standard action~[TAG_STANDARD_ACTION]Range: Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)Effect: RayDuration: InstantaneousSaving Throw: NoneSpell Resistance: YesA blue-white ray of freezing air and ice springs from your hand. You must succeed on a ranged ~touch attack~[TAG_TOUCH_ATTACK] with the ray to deal damage to a target. The ray deals 1d6 points of cold damage per ~caster level~[TAG_CASTER_LEVEL] (maximum 25d6).
TAG_BITE	TAG_WEAPONS			Bite Attack	The creature attacks with its mouth, dealing piercing, slashing, and bludgeoning damage.
TAG_CLASS_FEATURES_BARD_INSPIRE_GREATNESS	TAG_BARDS			Inspire Greatness	 A bard of 9th level or greater with 12 or more ranks in a ~Perform~[TAG_PERFORM] skill can use music or poetics to inspire greatness in himself or a single willing ally within 30 feet, granting him or her an extra fighting capability.  To inspire greatness, a bard must sing and be heard by an ally.  The effect lasts for as long as the ally hears the bard sing and for 5 rounds thereafter.  A creature inspired with greatness gains 2 bonus Hit Dice (d10s), the commensurate number of ~temporary hit points~[TAG_TEMPORARY_HIT_POINTS] (apply the target's ~Constitution~[TAG_CONSTITUTION] modifier, if any, to these bonus Hit Dice), a +2 competence bonus on attack rolls, and a +1 competence bonus on ~Fortitude~[TAG_FORTITUDE] saves.  The bonus Hit Dice count as regular Hit Dice for determining the effect of spells such as ~Sleep~[TAG_SPELLS_SLEEP].
TAG_CLASS_FEATURES_BARD_INSPIRE_HEROICS	TAG_BARDS			Inspire Heroics	 A bard of 15th level or greater with 18 or more ranks in a ~Perform~[TAG_PERFORM] skill can use music or poetics to inspire tremendous heroism in himself or a single willing ally within 30 feet. To inspire heroics, a bard must sing and an ally must hear the bard sing for a full round. A creature so inspired gains a +4 morale bonus on saving throws and a +4 dodge bonus to AC. The effect lasts for as long as the ally hears the bard sing and for up to 5 rounds thereafter. Inspire heroics is a mind-affecting ability.

TAG_ARCANE_TRICKSTERS	TAG_PRESTIGE_CLASSES			Arcane Tricksters	TBD Note: weapon-like spells are not yet implemented in ToEE, so sneak attack won't work with spells.
TAG_ASSASSINS	TAG_PRESTIGE_CLASSES			Assassins	The assassin is the master of dealing quick, lethal blows. Assassins also excel at infiltration and disguise. Assassins often function as spies, informants, killers for hire, or agents of vengeance. Their training in anatomy, stealth, poison, and the dark arts allows them to carry out missions of death with shocking, terrifying precision.Most rogues, monks, and bards who choose this class become examples of the classic assassin skulking in the shadows with a blade carrying certain death. Fighters, ex-paladins, rangers, druids, and barbarians operate as warrior assassins, with as much ability to kill in combat as from the shadows. Sorcerers, wizards, and clerics may be the most terrifying assassins of all, for with their spells they can infiltrate and slay with even greater impunity. Hit Die: d6Requirements:To qualify to become an assassin, a character must fulfill all the following criteria.  Alignment: Any evil.   Skills: Hide 8 ranks, Move Silently 8 ranks. Base Attack and Base Save Bonuses: see ~table~[TAG_CLASS_FEATURES_ASSASSIN]Class Skills: ~Bluff~[TAG_BLUFF], ~Diplomacy~[TAG_DIPLOMACY], ~Gather Information~[TAG_GATHER_INFORMATION], ~Hide~[TAG_HIDE], ~Intimidate~[TAG_INTIMIDATE], ~Listen~[TAG_LISTEN], ~Move Silently~[TAG_MOVE_SILENTLY], ~Open Lock~[TAG_OPEN_LOCK], ~Search~[TAG_SEARCH], ~Sense Motive~[TAG_SENSE_MOTIVE], ~Sleight of Hand~[TAG_SLEIGHT], ~Spot~[TAG_SPOT], ~Tumble~[TAG_TUMBLE], ~Use Magic Device~[TAG_UMD].Skill Points at Each Level: 4 + Int modifierClass Features:~Assassin Weapon and Armor Proficiency~[TAG_CLASS_FEATURES_ASSASSIN_WEAP_PROF]~Death Attack~[TAG_CLASS_FEATURES_ASSASSIN_DEATH_ATTACK]~Sneak Attack~[TAG_CLASS_FEATURES_ASSASSIN_SNEAK_ATTACK]~Spells~[TAG_CLASS_FEATURES_ASSASSIN_SPELLS]~Save Bonus against Poison~[TAG_CLASS_FEATURES_ASSASSIN_SAVE_VS_POISON]Uncanny Dodge (Ex): Starting at 2nd level, an assassin gains the ability to react to danger before his senses would normally allow him to even be aware of it. He retains his Dexterity bonus to AC (if any) regardless of being caught flat-footed or struck by an invisible attacker. (He still loses any Dexterity bonus to AC if immobilized.)@tIf a character gains uncanny dodge from a second class (such as a barbarian/rogue), the character automatically gains improved uncanny dodgeImproved Uncanny Dodge (Ex): At 5th level, an assassin can no longer be flanked, since he can react to opponents on opposite sides of him as easily as he can react to a single attacker. This defense denies rogues the ability to use flank attacks to sneak attack the assassin. The exception to this defense is that a rogue at least four levels higher than the assassin can flank him (and thus sneak attack him).@tIf a character gains uncanny dodge (see above) from a second class (such as a barbarian/rogue), the character automatically gains improved uncanny dodge, and the levels from those classes stack to determine the minimum rogue level required to flank the character.~Hide in Plain Sight~[TAG_CLASS_FEATURES_ASSASSIN_HIPS]
TAG_CLASS_FEATURES_ASSASSIN_WEAP_PROF	TAG_ASSASSINS			Assassin Weapon and Armor Proficiency	 An assassin's weapon training focuses on weapons suitable for stealth and sneak attacks. Assassins are proficient with the crossbow (hand, light, or heavy), dagger (any type), dart, rapier, sap, shortbow (normal and composite), and short sword. Assassins are proficient with light armor but not with shields. 
TAG_CLASS_FEATURES_ASSASSIN_SNEAK_ATTACK	TAG_ASSASSINS			Assassin Sneak Attack	This is exactly like the ~rogue ability~[TAG_CLASS_FEATURES_ROGUE_SNEAK_ATTACK] of the same name. The extra damage dealt increases by +1d6 every other level (2nd, 4th, 6th, 8th, and 10th). If an assassin gets a sneak attack bonus from another source (such as ~rogue~[TAG_ROGUES] levels), the bonuses on damage stack. 
TAG_CLASS_FEATURES_ASSASSIN_DEATH_ATTACK	TAG_ASSASSINS			Death Attack	 If an assassin studies his victim for 3 rounds and then makes a sneak attack with a melee weapon that successfully deals damage, the sneak attack has the additional effect of possibly either paralyzing or killing the target (assassin's choice). While studying the victim, the assassin can undertake other actions so long as his attention stays focused on the target and the target does not detect the assassin or recognize the assassin as an enemy. If the victim of such an attack fails a Fortitude save (DC 10 + the assassin's class level + the assassin's Int modifier) against the kill effect, she dies. If the saving throw fails against the paralysis effect, the victim's mind and body become enervated, rendering her helpless and unable to act for 1d6 rounds plus 1 round per level of the assassin. If the victim's saving throw succeeds, the attack is just a normal sneak attack. Once the assassin has completed the 3 rounds of study, he must make the death attack within the next 3 rounds. If a death attack is attempted and fails (the victim makes her save) or if the assassin does not launch the attack within 3 rounds of completing the study, 3 new rounds of study are required before he can attempt another death attack.
TAG_CLASS_FEATURES_ASSASSIN_HIPS	TAG_ASSASSINS			Hide in Plain Sight (Su)	At 8th level, an assassin can use the Hide skill even while being observed. As long as he is within 10 feet of some sort of shadow, an assassin can hide himself from view in the open without having anything to actually hide behind. He cannot, however, hide in his own shadow. 
TAG_CLASS_FEATURES_ASSASSIN_SPELLS	TAG_ASSASSINS			Assassin Spells	Beginning at 1st level, an assassin gains the ability to cast a number of arcane spells. To cast a spell, an assassin must have an ~Intelligence~[TAG_INTELLIGENCE] score of at least 10 + the spell's level, so an assassin with an Intelligence of 10 or lower cannot cast these spells. Assassin bonus spells are based on Intelligence, and saving throws against these spells have a DC of 10 + spell level + the assassin's Intelligence bonus (if any). When the assassin gets 0 spells per day of a given spell level (for instance, 1st-level spells for a 1st-level assassin), he gains only the bonus spells he would be entitled to based on his Intelligence score for that spell level. The assassin's spell list appears below. An assassin casts spells just as a ~bard~[TAG_BARDS] does. @tUpon reaching 6th level, at every even-numbered level after that (8th and 10th), an assassin can choose to learn a new spell in place of one he already knows. The new spell's level must be the same as that of the spell being exchanged, and it must be at least two levels lower than the highest-level assassin spell the assassin can cast. For instance, upon reaching 6th level, an assassin could trade in a single 1st-level spell (two spell levels below the highestlevel sorcerer spell he can cast, which is 3rd) for a different 1stlevel spell. At 8th and 10th levels, he could trade in a single 1stlevel or 2nd-level spell (since he now can cast 4th-level assassin spells) for a different spell of the same level. An assassin may swap only a single spell at any given level, and must choose whether or not to swap the spell at the same time that he gains new spells known for that level.Assassin Spell List   Assassins choose their spells from the following list: @t1st Level: ~grease~[TAG_SPELLS_GREASE], ~obscuring mist~[TAG_SPELLS_OBSCURING_MIST], ~sleep~[TAG_SPELLS_SLEEP], ~true strike~[TAG_SPELLS_TRUE_STRIKE].@t2nd Level: ~blindness / deafness~[TAG_SPELLS_BLINDNESS_DEAFNESS], ~cat's grace~[TAG_SPELLS_CATS_GRACE], ~fox's cunning~[TAG_SPELLS_FOX'S_CUNNING], ~ghoul touch~[TAG_SPELLS_GHOUL_TOUCH], ~invisibility~[TAG_SPELLS_INVISIBILITY]. @t3rd Level: ~deep slumber~[TAG_SPELLS_DEEP_SLUMBER], ~false life~[TAG_SPELLS_FALSE_LIFE], ~magic circle against good~[TAG_SPELLS_MAGIC_CIRCLE_AGAINST_GOOD],~slow~[TAG_SPELLS_SLOW], ~vampiric touch~[TAG_SPELLS_VAMPIRIC_TOUCH]. @t4th Level: ~clairaudience/clairvoyance~[TAG_SPELLS_CLAIRAUDIENCE_CLAIRVOYANCE], ~dimension door~[TAG_SPELLS_DIMENSION_DOOR], ~freedom of movement~[TAG_SPELLS_FREEDOM_OF_MOVEMENT], ~glibness~[TAG_SPELLS_GLIBNESS], ~greater invisibility~[TAG_SPELLS_INVISIBILITY_GREATER], ~modify memory~[TAG_SPELLS_MODIFY_MEMORY], ~poison~[TAG_SPELLS_POISON]. 
TAG_CLASS_FEATURES_ASSASSIN_SAVE_VS_POISON	TAG_ASSASSINS			Assassin Save vs. Poison	Assassins train with poisons of all types and slowly grow more and more resistant to their effects. This is reflected by a natural saving throw bonus to all poisons gained at 2nd level that increases by +1 for every two additional levels the assassin gains (+2 at 4th level, +3 at 6th level, and so on).
TAG_BLACKGUARDS	TAG_PRESTIGE_CLASSES			Blackguards	The blackguard epitomizes evil. He is nothing short of a mortal fiend. The quintessential black knight, this villain carries a reputation of the foulest sort that is very well deserved. Consorting with demons and devils and serving dark deities, the blackguard is hated and feared by all. Some people call these villains antipaladins due to their completely evil nature. The blackguard has many options available to him-sending forth dark minions and servants to do his bidding, attacking with stealth and honorless guile, or straightforward smiting of the forces of good that stand in his way. Fighters, ex-paladins, rangers, monks, druids, and barbarians make for indomitable combat-oriented blackguards, while rogues and bards who become blackguards are likely to stress the subtle aspects of their abilities and spells. Sorcerers, wizards, and clerics who become blackguards are sometimes called diabolists and favor dealing with fiends even more than other blackguards do.Hit Die: d10Requirements:To qualify to become a blackguard, a character must fulfill all the following criteria.@tAlignment: Any evil. @tBase Attack Bonus:+6.@tSkills: Hide 5 ranks@tFeats: Cleave, Power Attack. Base Attack and Base Save Bonuses: see ~table~[TAG_CLASS_FEATURES_BLACKGUARD]Class Skills: ~Concentration~[TAG_CONCENTRATION], ~Diplomacy~[TAG_DIPLOMACY], ~Heal~[TAG_HEAL], ~Hide~[TAG_HIDE], ~Intimidate~[TAG_INTIMIDATE]Skill Points at Each Level: 2 + Int modifierClass Features:Weapon and Armor Proficiency: Blackguards are proficient with all simple and martial weapons, with all types of armor, and with shields. Dark Blessing (Su): A blackguard applies his Charisma modifier (if positive) as a bonus on all saving throws. Spells: A blackguard has the ability to cast a small number of divine spells. To cast a blackguard spell, a blackguard must have a Wisdom score of at least 10 + the spell's level, so a blackguard with a Wisdom of 10 or lower cannot cast these spells. Blackguard bonus spells are based on Wisdom, and saving throws against these spells have a DC of 10 + spell level + the blackguard's Wisdom modifier. When the blackguard gets 0 spells per day of a given spell level (for instance, 1st-level spells for a 1st-level blackguard), he gains only the bonus spells he would be entitled to based on his Wisdom score for that spell level. The blackguard's spell list appears below. A blackguard has access to any spell on the list and can freely choose which to prepare, just as a cleric. A blackguard prepares and casts spells just as a cleric does (though a blackguard cannot spontaneously cast cure or inflictspells). Smite Good (Su): Once a day, a blackguard of 2nd level or higher may attempt to smite good with one normal melee attack. He adds his Charisma modifier (if positive) to his attack roll and deals 1 extra point of damage per class level. For example, a 9th-level blackguard armed with a longsword would deal 1d8+9 points of damage, plus any additional bonuses from high Strength or magical effects that normally apply. If a blackguard accidentally smites a creature that is not good, the smite has no effect but it is still used up for that day. At 5th level, and again at 10th level, a blackguard may smite good one additional time per day. Aura of Despair (Su):Beginning at 3rd level, the blackguard radiates a malign aura that causes enemies within 10 feet of him to take a –2 penalty on all saving throws. Command Undead (Su): When a blackguard reaches 3rd level, he gains the supernatural ability to command and rebuke undead. He commands undead as would a cleric of two levels lower.Sneak Attack: This ability, gained at 4th level, is like the rogue ability of the same name. The extra damage increases by +1d6 every third level beyond 4th (7th and 10th). If a blackguard gets a sneak attack bonus from another source (such as rogue levels), the bonuses on damage stack.Fallen Paladins@tBlackguards who have levels in the paladin class (that is to say, are now ex-paladins) gain extra abilities the more levels of paladin they have.@tLevel 1+:   Smite good 1/day@tLevel 5+:    Sneak attack damage increased by +1d6. Smite good 2/day.@tLevel 9+:   Smite good 3/day@tThe rest of the Fallen Paladin bonuses are yet to be implemented.Fiendish Servant: like the Paladin's mount, this class feature is not implemented. 
TAG_DUELISTS	TAG_PRESTIGE_CLASSES			Duelists	TBD 
TAG_DWARVEN_DEFENDERS	TAG_PRESTIGE_CLASSES			Dwarven Defenders	TBD 
TAG_ELDRITCH_KNIGHTS	TAG_PRESTIGE_CLASSES			Eldritch Knights	Studying the martial and arcane arts to equal degree, the eldritch knight is a versatile combatant who can cast a fireball on her foes or charge them with sword drawn. The eldritch knight takes pride in her ability to use the right technique for the job: spells against physically tough foes and force of arms against spellcasting enemies.Eldritch knights split their time between physical training to become better soldiers and arcane study to learn more powerful spells. They tend to be driven individuals, because simultaneously perfecting their spellcasting and combat prowess requires immense time and effort. Eldritch knights are never truly at home among arcane spellcasters or elite soldiers, so many drift from wizard school to mercenary unit to band of adventurers.Every would-be eldritch knight must demonstrate both skill with a broad array of weapons and mastery of the basics of arcane spellcasting. Thus, almost all eldritch knights are multiclass characters already, with fighter/wizard the most common combination. A few eldritch knights were once bards, and even paladin/sorcerers aren't unheard of. Eldritch knights can be found wherever there's a good fight or the promise of arcane lore. They find higher level fighters and wizards particularly interesting, and some eldritch knights apprentice themselves for a time to learn the finer points of arcane technique or weapons prowess. Hit Die: d6Requirements:To qualify to become an eldritch knight, a character must fulfill all the following criteria.@tWeapon Proficiency: Must be proficient with all martial weapons.@tSpells:Able to cast 3rd-level arcane spells. Base Attack and Base Save Bonuses: see ~table~[TAG_CLASS_FEATURES_ELDRITCH_KNIGHT].Class Skills: ~Concentration~[TAG_CONCENTRATION], ~Sense Motive~[TAG_SENSE_MOTIVE], ~Spellcraft~[TAG_SPELLCRAFT]Skill Points at Each Level: 2 + Int modifierClass Features:Weapon and Armor Proficiency: Eldritch knights gain no proficiency with any weapon or armor.Bonus Feat: At 1st level, an eldritch knight may choose a bonus feat from the list of feats available to fighters. This is in addition to the feats that a character of any class normally gets every three levels. The character must still meet any prerequisites for these bonus feats, including four levels of fighter for the Weapon Specialization feat.Spells per Day:From 2nd level on, when a new eldritch knight level is gained, the character gains new spells per day as if she had also gained a level in whatever arcane spellcasting class she belonged to before she added the prestige class. She does not, however, gain any other benefit a character of that class would have gained (bonus metamagic or item creation feats, bard or assassin abilities, and so on). This essentially means that she adds the level of eldritch knight to the level of whatever other arcane spellcasting class the character has, then determines spells per day and caster level accordingly. Known spells will also advance accordingly.@tIf a character had more than one arcane spellcasting class before she became an eldritch knight, the one with the higher level will be chosen for the purpose of adding spells per day.
